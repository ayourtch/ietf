                       draft-ayourtch-tcp-loic-00

Abstract

   This document discusses a possible approach to TCP option space

Internet-Draft                  TCP LOIC                      April 2011


1.  Introduction

   What this document IS NOT:  the definitive guide, the review of the
   existing solutions, the full description of the option space upgrade,
   the review of the existing solutions.

   What this document IS:  a write-up of an idea for a building block to
   be used as part of a bigger protocol - intended for information
   purposes and further development only.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Problem Statement

   The TCP options are the mechanism which is used to evolve the TCP
   protocol - thanks to their existence, such additions as Selective
   Acknowledgements and Timestamps [refs tbd] (to name just a couple)
   were introduced.  However, the space in the TCP segment where the
   options may be transmitted is very scarce and is currently at the
   borderline of being exhausted.  This practically blocks any further
   development in the TCP protocol space.

   In order for the TCP development to continue, we need a way to
   dedicate a larger storage space for TCP options within the segment -
   further referred as TCP Long Options.

   A mechanism for doing that must fulfil at least two prerequisites:
   transmission of the Long Options within the TCP SYN, and a graceful
   fallback to the 'legacy' mechanism in case the Long Options can not
   be used (thus abandoning all of the Long Options).

   The above two are to certain extent at odds with each other - the SYN
   is the very first segment within the TCP session, so any drastic
   change that is misunderstood by the remote party or the middleboxes
   will cause the segment to be dropped, thus interrupting the
   communication.


4.  Proposed High-level Approach

   The proposal is to transmit two SYN segments instead of one, created
   with different goals in mind:  the first one, aimed at backwards

   compatibility, would merely signal the sender's desire to use Long
   Options.  The second SYN segment, aimed at the parties that
   understand the new mechanism, would contain the Long Options
   themselves.  The Long Options would be in place where there normally
   is data (there's simply no other space) - so this segment, together
   with the first one, would form a contradiction from the perspective
   of the TCP protocol, if interpreted by the unaware node.

   To mitigate the above issue, we can explicitly mark the second SYN as
   "TCP-invalid".  The simplest way to do this is to increment the valid
   TCP checksum by 2.  With such a modification, the second packet will
   be either dropped by a middlebox that does not support the new
   method, or by the destination node itself - if the destionation does
   not support this method.

   On the other hand, if the stack supports the new method for the Long
   Options, it can treat the first segment as a partial duplicate of the
   second - thus allowing to upgrade the protocol behaviour.  (NB:  the
   overall upgrade protocol is a much larger problem and is out of scope
   for this document).


5.  Implementation Details

   Allocate two new TCP options:  a 4 bytes long "LOIC-FLAG" and a 4
   bytes long "LOIC-LEN" (Long Options with Invalidated Checksum).

   The first one is aimed into inclusion into the 'compatible segments'
   to signal that the system understands the long options mechanism, as
   well as later possibly be used as a signaling mechanism about the
   end-to-end connectivity for the Long Options segments.  The goal here
   is to minimize the potential of the disruption for the existing
   applications.

   The two bytes of usable payload of the second option will hold the
   length of the TCP Long Options area (zero being an allowed value and
   meaning there is no Long Options at all).  The TCP Long Options area
   will be placed between the end of the 'classic' TCP header and the
   beginning of the TCP segment data.  The presence of this option will
   mean that before verifying the TCP checksum, one MUST decrement the
   received value by 2 - and only then verify the checksum.  To allow
   more efficiency in the implementations, this option MUST be the first
   TCP option within the segment - this way the analysis of the TCP
   checksum would not be impacted too much.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The concept of using the invalid checksum came up during one of the
   discussions with Dan Wing about an unrelated matter.  Thanks to
   following individuals for the initial discussions about this idea:
   Wesley Eddy, Alan Ford, Anantha Ramaiah, Fernando Gont [[ Please
   remind me who I forgot, I forgot a few folks for sure ]]


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document, being informational, has no IANA actions.  However,
   its derivatives that adopt the described approach, would have an
   action to update the registry of the TCP options to include the LOIC-
   FLAG and LOIC-LEN definitions.
